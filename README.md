ottd_preview
============

Preview generator for OpenTTD saves/scenarios

Includes a QuickLook generator for Mac OS X, and a cross-platform command-line
utility for generating a PNG preview of the map, in isometric (resembling the
OpenTTD map window) or flat orientations, and a text output with company names
and colours, useful for a generation utility.
